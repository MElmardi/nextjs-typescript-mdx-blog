## Hello World!
Greetings, Welcome to the first post on my website. I'd like to share the reasons behind starting this blog and give you a glimpse of what you can expect to find here.

## Why Did I Start This Blog?
In a nutshell, this blog serves as an archive for my thoughts and discoveries. While I don't claim to be an expert in any specific field, I have an insatiable curiosity and a penchant for learning new things, whether they are directly related to my job or not. However, I often find that once I learn something, it tends to fade away from memory over time. When I later need to revisit that knowledge or share it with others, I end up having to relearn it. By creating this blog, I aim to save myself time and effort by documenting what I learn. Additionally, it will serve as a convenient resource for sharing information with others by simply providing them with a link to the relevant article.

What Will I Be Writing About?
a wide range of topics in the realm of technology and programming. From Next.js to Docker, and from AI to whatever exciting developments the future holds, I will cover a diverse array of subjects. Simply put, I will be writing about anything and everything I learn that I believe is worth sharing.

## In Summary
To sum it up, this blog will be a repository for my ever-expanding knowledge, serving as a reference for myself and a resource for anyone who finds the content useful or interesting. I am thrilled to share my insights with you all.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Peace out! ✌️
